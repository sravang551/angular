ANGULAR.JS EXAMPLE

I have made a to-do list using html5, css3, bootstrap, angularjs. It is a basic todo list using angularjs in which you can create, edit, delete a to do list.

I have also made a project using angular.js which shows a basic page and whatever is written in the textbox will be displayed on the screen. The example uses only Angular’s directives, and is the simplest app possible using the framework.In the code, I used Angular’s directives to set and read the active variable. When it changes, it causes the HTML that uses it to be updated automatically. this variable is a model. It is available to all directives in the current scope, and can be accessed in controllers.
